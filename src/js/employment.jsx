    <h3> RoosterOil Software </h3>
    <Text>
      At RoosterOil Software I worked as a fullstack web developer building
      application features within the ASP.NET ecosystem. I used Entity Framework,
      Blazor, Tailwind CSS to create new functionality and expand existing processess
      in direct response to our client's most exigent needs. RoosterOil is a small
      privately funded startup, as such my time there was spent fulfilling a wide array
      of non software duties aswell. I would travel across NJ to perform installations of
      our hardware at client venues. Connect with customers, to put a face on the virtual
      entity they communicated with in Boston. I would create a expirements and perform experiments
      with our hardware at venues to discover issues mired in the gulf between headquarters and 
      our clients.
